# Flight Etiquette: Moving to an Unsold Seat 
I picked the survey question **“Is it rude to move to an unsold seat on a plane?”** because it explores people’s expectations around personal space and flying etiquette. What I found most interesting is that the vast majority — 690 respondents — felt moving to an empty seat was not rude at all. This matters because it reveals a more relaxed social attitude towards travel and personal boundaries on flights.
